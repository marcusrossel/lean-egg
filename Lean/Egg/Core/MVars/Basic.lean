1. An mvar is `unconditionallyVisible` if it appears explicitly in the given expression, but not in
   a type class instance or proof term. For example, this holds for `?m` in `f (?m + 1)`.
2. An mvar `isTcInst` if its type is a type class. For example, this holds for `?i` in
   `@Add Nat ?i`.
3. An mvar is `inTcInstTerm` if it appears explicitly in a term whose type is a type class. For
   example, this holds for both `?t` and `?i` in `@instHAdd ?t ?i`.
4. An mvar is `inErasedTcInst` if it appears explicitly in the type of a term whose type is a type
   class. For example, this holds for `?t` but not for `?i` in `@instHAdd ?t ?i`. The type of this
   instance is `HAdd ?t ?t ?t`.
5. An mvar is `inProofTerm` if it appears explicitly in a term whose type is a proposition. For
   example, this holds for `?m` and `?n` in `Nat.add_comm ?m ?n`.
6. An mvar is `inErasedProof` if it appears explicitly in the type of a term whose type is a
   proposition. For example, this holds for `?m` and `?n` in `Nat.add_comm ?m ?n`. The type of this
   proof is `?m + ?n = ?n + ?m`.

A commonly required composite property is whether an mvar will appear in the final encoded term. We
say that such an mvar is "visible". Visibility depends on Properties 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6, as well as
the erasure configuration. The visibility property is used for the following:
* To implement explosion.
* To determine the valid directions of a rewrite.
* To determine which mvars are conditions of a rewrite.
* To determine whether a given condition of a conditional rewrite is unbounded.

Other use cases of properties are:
* To determine which mvars are conditions of a rewrite, we also need to use Properties 1, 3 and 5.
* Type class specialization needs Property 2.
